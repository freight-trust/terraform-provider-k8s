## metadata



    
#### annotations

######  TypeMap

Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations
#### creation_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

CreationTimestamp is a timestamp representing the server time when this object was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Null for lists. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### deletion_grace_period_seconds

######  ReadOnly • TypeInt

Number of seconds allowed for this object to gracefully terminate before it will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set. May only be shortened. Read-only.
#### deletion_timestamp

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked. Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#metadata
#### labels

######  TypeMap

Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
#### name

######  TypeString

Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
#### namespace

######  TypeString

Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.

Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
#### resource_version

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular resource or set of resources.

Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients and . More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/api-conventions.md#concurrency-control-and-consistency
#### self_link

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

SelfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.
#### uid

######  ReadOnly • TypeString

UID is the unique in time and space value for this object. It is typically generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not allowed to change on PUT operations.

Populated by the system. Read-only. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#uids
## spec

Spec describes how the user wants the resources to appear

    
## additional_printer_columns

AdditionalPrinterColumns are additional columns shown e.g. in kubectl next to the name. Defaults to a created-at column. Optional, the global columns for all versions. Top-level and per-version columns are mutually exclusive.

    
#### description

######  TypeString

description is a human readable description of this column.
#### format

######  TypeString

format is an optional OpenAPI type definition for this column. The 'name' format is applied to the primary identifier column to assist in clients identifying column is the resource name. See https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#data-types for more.
#### json_path

###### Required •  TypeString

JSONPath is a simple JSON path, i.e. with array notation.
#### name

###### Required •  TypeString

name is a human readable name for the column.
#### priority

######  TypeInt

priority is an integer defining the relative importance of this column compared to others. Lower numbers are considered higher priority. Columns that may be omitted in limited space scenarios should be given a higher priority.
#### type

###### Required •  TypeString

type is an OpenAPI type definition for this column. See https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#data-types for more.
## conversion

`conversion` defines conversion settings for the CRD.

    
#### conversion_review_versions

######  TypeList

ConversionReviewVersions is an ordered list of preferred `ConversionReview` versions the Webhook expects. API server will try to use first version in the list which it supports. If none of the versions specified in this list supported by API server, conversion will fail for this object. If a persisted Webhook configuration specifies allowed versions and does not include any versions known to the API Server, calls to the webhook will fail. Default to `['v1beta1']`.
#### strategy

###### Required •  TypeString

`strategy` specifies the conversion strategy. Allowed values are: - `None`: The converter only change the apiVersion and would not touch any other field in the CR. - `Webhook`: API Server will call to an external webhook to do the conversion. Additional information
  is needed for this option. This requires spec.preserveUnknownFields to be false.
## webhook_client_config

`webhookClientConfig` is the instructions for how to call the webhook if strategy is `Webhook`. This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature.

    
#### cabundle

######  TypeString

`caBundle` is a PEM encoded CA bundle which will be used to validate the webhook's server certificate. If unspecified, system trust roots on the apiserver are used.
## service

`service` is a reference to the service for this webhook. Either `service` or `url` must be specified.

If the webhook is running within the cluster, then you should use `service`.

    
#### name

###### Required •  TypeString

`name` is the name of the service. Required
#### namespace

###### Required •  TypeString

`namespace` is the namespace of the service. Required
#### path

######  TypeString

`path` is an optional URL path which will be sent in any request to this service.
#### port

######  TypeInt

If specified, the port on the service that hosting webhook. Default to 443 for backward compatibility. `port` should be a valid port number (1-65535, inclusive).
#### url

######  TypeString

`url` gives the location of the webhook, in standard URL form (`scheme://host:port/path`). Exactly one of `url` or `service` must be specified.

The `host` should not refer to a service running in the cluster; use the `service` field instead. The host might be resolved via external DNS in some apiservers (e.g., `kube-apiserver` cannot resolve in-cluster DNS as that would be a layering violation). `host` may also be an IP address.

Please note that using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` as a `host` is risky unless you take great care to run this webhook on all hosts which run an apiserver which might need to make calls to this webhook. Such installs are likely to be non-portable, i.e., not easy to turn up in a new cluster.

The scheme must be "https"; the URL must begin with "https://".

A path is optional, and if present may be any string permissible in a URL. You may use the path to pass an arbitrary string to the webhook, for example, a cluster identifier.

Attempting to use a user or basic auth e.g. "user:password@" is not allowed. Fragments ("#...") and query parameters ("?...") are not allowed, either.

#### singular

######  TypeString

Singular is the singular name of the resource.  It must be all lowercase  Defaults to lowercased <kind>
#### preserve_unknown_fields

## versions

Versions is the list of all supported versions for this resource. If Version field is provided, this field is optional. Validation: All versions must use the same validation schema for now. i.e., top level Validation field is applied to all of these versions. Order: The version name will be used to compute the order. If the version string is "kube-like", it will sort above non "kube-like" version strings, which are ordered lexicographically. "Kube-like" versions start with a "v", then are followed by a number (the major version), then optionally the string "alpha" or "beta" and another number (the minor version). These are sorted first by GA > beta > alpha (where GA is a version with no suffix such as beta or alpha), and then by comparing major version, then minor version. An example sorted list of versions: v10, v2, v1, v11beta2, v10beta3, v3beta1, v12alpha1, v11alpha2, foo1, foo10.

    
## additional_printer_columns

AdditionalPrinterColumns are additional columns shown e.g. in kubectl next to the name. Defaults to a created-at column. Top-level and per-version columns are mutually exclusive. Per-version columns must not all be set to identical values (top-level columns should be used instead) This field is alpha-level and is only honored by servers that enable the CustomResourceWebhookConversion feature. NOTE: CRDs created prior to 1.13 populated the top-level additionalPrinterColumns field by default. To apply an update that changes to per-version additionalPrinterColumns, the top-level additionalPrinterColumns field must be explicitly set to null
